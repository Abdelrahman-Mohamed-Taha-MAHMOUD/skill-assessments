# Working with Genomic Variant Files

Pre-requisites: [Linux for Bioinformatics](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/skill-assessments/tree/main/Linux%20for%20Bioinformatics)

## Instructions

The purpose of this challenge is to understand and utilize some of the most common filetypes generated from genomic data: [VCF](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/blob/master/VCFv4.3.pdf) and [MAF](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/). The purpose of this challenge is to learn to interpret variant calls when presented in these formats and to manipulate these file types.
